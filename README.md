# learn-go-with-tests

My way through [Learn Go With Tests].

Adding my comments and tests, like in [iteration], I compare benchmarks with
the equivalent in strings.

These are structured by sections.

List:
- [go-fundamentals]
  + [hello-world]
  + [integers]
  + [iteration]
  + [arrays-and-slices]
  + [structs-methods-and-interfaces]
  + [pointers-and-errors]
  + [maps]
  + [dependency-injection]
  + [mocking]
  + [concurrency]
