# learn-go-with-tests

My way through [Learn Go With Tests].

Adding my comments and tests, like in [iteration], I compare benchmarks with
the equivalent in strings.

These are structured by sections.

List:
- [go-fundamentals]
  + [hello-world]
  + [integers]
  + [iteration]
  + [arrays-and-slices]
  + [structs-methods-and-interfaces]

[go-fundamentals]: go-fundamentals
[hello-world]: go-fundamentals/hello-world
[integers]: go-fundamentals/integers
[iteration]: go-fundamentals/iteration
[arrays-and-slices]: go-fundamentals/arrays-and-slices
[structs-methods-and-interfaces]: go-fundamentals/structs-methods-and-interfaces
